## Welcome to the A1 programming language documentation

A1 is Adamnite's smart contract programming language. A1 aims to bring the simplicity and expressiveness of Pythonic syntax to the blockchain world. 
It is designed to make it easy for experienced as well as new developers alike to write, test and deploy smart contracts on Adamnite's ecosystem. 
<br>
With A1, you can write smart contracts using familiar Python syntax and semantics, while also taking advantage of the security and immutability 
provided by the blockchain. This documentation will guide you through the process of writing, testing and deploying A1 smart contracts, 
as well as provide examples and best practices for common use cases.
