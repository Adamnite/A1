# I. Introduction

A1 is Adamnite's smart contract programming language. It aims to bring the **simplicity and expressiveness** of Pythonic syntax to the blockchain world. It is designed to make it easy for **both experienced and less experienced developers** to write, test and deploy smart contracts on Adamnite's ecosystem.

With A1, you can write smart contracts using familiar Python syntax and semantics, while also taking advantage of the **security and immutability** provided by the blockchain.

This documentation will guide you through the process of writing, testing and deploying A1 smart contracts,
as well as provide examples and best practices for common use cases.

### Key Features

A1 provides an easy-to-use script that is inherently readable, supports the use of data feeds and external APIs, and is modular, allowing for the use of packages and standards that can drive the creation of complex contracts. This standard library in particular will serve to make the development of contracts easier, and will also protect developers from making rudimentary errors that can compromise their contract.

You can read more about A1's technical specifications in the Programming Language and Execution section of Adamnite's [Technical Paper](https://adamnite.org/Adamnite_Technical_Paper.pdf).

# II. Getting Started

- Installation and setup all A1 source files utilize the `.ao` extension.
