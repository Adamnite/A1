An inital copy of this software drew major inspiration and used a portion of the code from the
open-source Github Repository "Pinecone", a repository containing code for a simple and efficient 
programming language. The license for Pinecone, which is also an open-source software, is included below
Please note that Adamnite reserves the right to remove this licence once A1 evolves to a point where none 
of the code, structure, or ideas are derived from Pinecone. The inital copy was created only for the purpose
of demonstration, and will have  no similarities with the final product.
